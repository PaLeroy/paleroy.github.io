I completed a Ph.D. in **machine learning** in June 2024. My research focuses on training teams of agents with **multi-agent reinforcement learning**. Aside, I conducted projects on **neural network compression** for computer vision and **robust reinforcement learning** for drone control applications. I am particularly passionate about applying machine learning to address **real-world** challenges and contribute to **impactful applications**.  

I am the co-founder and CEO of **Belerion**, a startup developing **AI technologies for defense**. We specialize in **counter-UAS solutions** powered by multi-agent reinforcement learning, with expertise in simulating both defenders and attackers to design resilient strategies. Our work spans the entire value chain of effectors: from **unlocking sensors** for precise detection and identification, to enabling **super-human control** with decision-aid systems, and **optimizing performance at the system level** through data fusion and operational planning.
